          <p>To my Cindy,</p>
          <p>First I want to thank you for giving time to read this as I know how busy your life is. I tried my best to keep
            this short but there's just a lot of things I want to say, so please forgive me for that.
            <p>
              I'm writing this because this is the only way I can fix myself from the wounds you left, to fill the empty hole that I told
              you that it's perfect fit for you. The pain is slowly consuming me, and it has to stop somehow. So please don't
              think that I'm writing this to hurt you.</p>
            <p>
              Thank you, for everything. You made me a better person since you came in to my life. You're the only person who knows me,
              inside out, or hindi, maybe nung nalaman mo totoong ugali ko, inayawan mo na ko. I don't know, maybe I still
              don't understand, maybe I will never undestand, anyway it just pains me a lot to know that you fell out of
              love the same reason you fell.
            </p>
            <p>I'm not perfect. I said things na hindi ko dapat, and I'm sorry for that, sorry for making you feel shit when
              I should have done otherwise. Masakit din sa'kin mga nasasabi ko pero hindi naman yun rason para masaktan ka
              diba? So, sorry, please forgive me for everything, sometimes I think that you don't deserve me, I mean, you
              have a good heart, and I don't even have one. I understand if you still hate me for that. But please, admit
              that we had a lot of fun times together, maraming first, maraming last, but what's important is we had fun
              doing it, right? Sana hindi lang ako ang nag enjoy. Kung ano man yung mga moments na yun, good or bad, I poured
              every inch of my being sa'yo, and it made me love you more...with all my
              <img src="./img/like.svg" alt="heart" class="heart">
            </p>
            <p>We are partners, or should I say, were. It's us against the world, and it made me feel, you know, complete. That
              I don't need anyone to make me happy, to make me feel the way you make me feel. You are my everything. You
              may not felt the same but I know that I complete you. Pero things change, nagaaway na tayo, ng sobra, na I
              thought healthy, but you're crying yourself to sleep na. It's been a roller coaster of emotions. I got scared
              that I might lose you, the only person whom I gave my all. Having felt that, akala ko mas magiging mabuti akong
              boyfriend sayo, but I think it got worse. You just don't deserve to be with me anymore and even though I still
              love you, thoughts came that I should let you go. On and off pero sa huli, I still lost you.</p>
            <p>I lost the girl that I love. I lost the person who made me the happiest. I lost the "good morning/night baby
              i love you ;*". I lost the hintayan. I lost the fights that ends up us laughing about it minutes after. I lost
              the touches, the hugs, the kisses, the intimate moments. Loosing you, I lost everything and god knows, or whoever
              knows, how much I badly miss them.</p>
            <p>I still hate myself for everything. I don't know when will I get over this self-hate that came with the sadness
              over us. There's still a lot of questions I have: Was I not enough? Do you not love me anymore? May iba ka
              na ba? Bakit hindi mo ko pinaglaban? Whatever the answers, maybe I know the answers, I don't think it will
              change my feelings because it surely won't change the fact that you're gone. Maybe I won't get the closure
              I want, or this is closure? Kasi maya't maya ko pa rin tinitignan kung online ka. Maya't maya ko pa rin hinihintay
              kung may message ka. Maybe you closed your doors for me na. But I'm in the process of building myself. Kailangan
              kong sanayin ulit sarili ko sa "me" instead of "we." I know I'll learn a lot from this, so thank you.</p>
            <p>I thank you for the broken promises, and the hurtful words. I thank you for all the times you chose other people
              over me/ I thank you for being your least priority. I thank you for the inconsistency and the plans never made
              into action. I thank you for the times you almost drive me insane, wondering if I did something wrong. I thank
              you for the heartbreak. It is indeed painful â€” more than I could ever put into words. But it helped me, somehow.
              So thank you.
            </p>
            <p>It's just been weeks and my heart still shatters every time I'm reminded of you. Damn, I'll still do everything
              I can do for you in a heartbeat. I know I have to teach myself to stop, teach the way you taught me how to
              love you. You'll always be a part of me but someday, I'll be able to let you go, hopefully, slowly. This letter
              is one way of doing that, and I find comfort in that.</p>
            <p>I still love you, so much, maybe more than yesterday. But then again, the pain has to stop somehow. I always
              wish you the best, even the best doesn't include me. I see you're happier without me and it makes me feel sad
              and disappointed in failing to make you feel that when I had the chance, but at least I know that you're doing
              what you want.</p>
